          <h2>Importance of Regulations</h2>
          <p>
            Domiciliary care regulations are essential for several reasons:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ensuring the safety and well-being of service users</li>
            <li>Maintaining high standards of care quality</li>
            <li>Protecting the rights and dignity of individuals receiving care</li>
            <li>Providing a framework for care providers to operate within</li>
            <li>Promoting transparency and accountability in the care sector</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Key Regulatory Bodies</h2>
          <p>
            Each nation within the United Kingdom has its own regulatory body responsible for overseeing domiciliary
            care services:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>England:</strong> Care Quality Commission (CQC)</li>
            <li><strong>Scotland:</strong> Care Inspectorate</li>
            <li><strong>Wales:</strong> Care Inspectorate Wales</li>
            <li><strong>Northern Ireland:</strong> Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority (RQIA)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These regulatory bodies are responsible for registering, inspecting, and monitoring domiciliary care
            providers to ensure they meet the required standards of quality and safety.

      <h2>Differences in Regulations Across the UK</h2>
      <p>
        While the overall goal of ensuring quality and safety in domiciliary care is consistent across the UK, there
        are some differences in the specific regulations and requirements in each nation:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>England follows the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014</li>
        <li>Scotland operates under the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Act 2010 and the Social Care and Social
          Work Improvement Scotland (Requirements for Care Services) Regulations 2011
        </li>
        <li>Wales adheres to the Regulation and Inspection of Social Care (Wales) Act 2016</li>
        <li>Northern Ireland is governed by the Health and Personal Social Services (Quality, Improvement and
          Regulation) (Northern Ireland) Order 2003
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Despite these differences, all regulatory bodies aim to maintain high standards and ensure the delivery of
        safe, effective, and person-centered care.
