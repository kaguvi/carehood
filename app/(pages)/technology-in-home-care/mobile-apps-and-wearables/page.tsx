      <p>Some successful examples include Birdie which has successfully implemented its platform in several UK care agencies, 
        resulting in a 30% reduction in missed visits and a 20% improvement in care quality ratings.</p>
    <p>A domiciliary care provider in Oxfordshire has reportedly implemented fall detectors for elderly clients,

        When selecting mobile health apps and wearables for domiciliary care, it&apos;s essential to consider the specific needs and 
        preferences of care recipients and caregivers. Involving them in the decision-making process and providing adequate
