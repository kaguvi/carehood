          <h2>Role and Responsibilities of the CQC</h2>
          <p>
            The CQC is responsible for registering, monitoring, and inspecting domiciliary care providers in England. It
            sets essential standards of quality and safety that providers must meet and takes enforcement action when
            necessary to protect the welfare of service users.

          <h2>Registration Process for Domiciliary Care Providers</h2>
          <p>
            To operate legally in England, domiciliary care providers must register with the CQC. The registration
            process involves:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Submitting an application with detailed information about the provider and its services</li>
            <li>Demonstrating compliance with essential standards of quality and safety</li>
            <li>Undergoing a pre-registration inspection by the CQC</li>
            <li>Paying the required registration fees</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Essential Standards of Quality and Safety</h2>
          <p>
            The CQC has established essential standards of quality and safety that domiciliary care providers must meet.
            These standards cover areas such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Person-centered care</li>
            <li>Dignity and respect</li>
            <li>Consent</li>
            <li>Safety</li>
            <li>Safeguarding from abuse</li>
            <li>Staffing</li>
            <li>Complaints handling</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Inspection Process and Ratings System</h2>
          <p>
            The CQC conducts regular inspections of domiciliary care providers to assess their compliance with essential
            standards. Inspections may be announced or unannounced and involve:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Observing care delivery</li>
            <li>Reviewing records and policies</li>
            <li>Interviewing staff, service users, and their families</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Following an inspection, the CQC rates the provider as Outstanding, Good, Requires Improvement, or
            Inadequate. Ratings are published on the CQC website to help service users make informed choices about their
            care.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Enforcement Actions for Non-Compliance</h2>
          <p>
            If a domiciliary care provider fails to meet essential standards, the CQC may take enforcement action, such
            as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Issuing a warning notice or requirement notice</li>
            <li>Imposing conditions on the provider&apos;s registration</li>
            <li>Suspending or canceling the provider&apos;s registration</li>
            <li>Prosecuting the provider in serious cases</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
