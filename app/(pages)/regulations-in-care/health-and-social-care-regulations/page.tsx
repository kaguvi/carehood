          <h2>Fundamental Standards of Care</h2>
          <p>
            The <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/about-us/fundamental-standards" title="fundamental standards of care">fundamental standards of care</a> are the minimum standards that all providers must meet.
            They cover areas such as person-centered care, dignity and respect, consent, safety, safeguarding,
            and staffing. Failure to meet these standards can result in enforcement action by the CQC.</p>

      <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8">
        <div>
          <h2>Duty of Candour and Fit and Proper Person Requirement</h2>
          <p>The duty of candour (Regulation 20) requires providers to be open and transparent with service users about
            their care and treatment, including when things go wrong. Providers must notify the relevant person of any
            unintended or unexpected incident that occurred during the provision of care or treatment that resulted in,
            or could have resulted in, harm to the service user.</p>
          <p>The fit and proper person requirement (Regulation 19) requires providers to ensure that all directors, or
            equivalent persons, are fit and proper to carry out their roles. This includes checks on their character,
            competence, health, and qualifications.</p>

        <div>
          <h2>Implications for Care Providers and Managers</h2>
          <p>Care providers and managers must ensure that their services meet the fundamental standards of care and
            comply with the other provisions of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations
            2014. This includes:</p>
          <ul>

            <li>Training staff on the regulations and their responsibilities</li>
            <li>Monitoring compliance and taking action to address any issues</li>
            <li>Notifying the CQC of any incidents or changes in service provision</li>
            <li>Displaying the provider&apos;s CQC rating and responding to any enforcement action</li>
          </ul>
