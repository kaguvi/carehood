        <h2>Safeguarding Principles and Legislation</h2>
        <p>Safeguarding is a critical aspect of domiciliary care, ensuring that vulnerable adults are protected from abuse, neglect, and exploitation. The key principles of safeguarding include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Empowerment: Supporting and encouraging individuals to make their own decisions</li>
          <li>Prevention: Taking action before harm occurs</li>
          <li>Proportionality: Responding in a way that is least intrusive and proportionate to the risk presented</li>
          <li>Protection: Supporting and representing those in greatest need</li>
          <li>Partnership: Working collaboratively with local communities to prevent, detect, and report abuse</li>
          <li>Accountability: Being transparent about safeguarding practices and outcomes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The primary legislation governing safeguarding in England is the {' '}
          <Link href="/regulations-in-care/health-and-social-care-regulations">Health and Social Care Act</Link>,
          which sets out a clear legal framework for safeguarding adults.

          <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/anaw/2014/4/contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wales</a>,
